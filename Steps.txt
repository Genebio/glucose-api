The main objective of this tech challenge is to build an API to store glucose 
levels. The blood glucose level is a key indicator for the human metabolism so it's 
important for our users to be able to store and access the data. 
Please use FastAPI. 
organize, design, test and document the code as if it were going into production.

data folder contains three sample  csv files which contain glucose values for users.
Create data model to store glucose values.
Also supply means of loading the sample data into the model/database (use SQLAlchemy and sqlite database).

Implement the following API endpoints which use the model / database:
1) "/api/v1/levels/"  Retrieve ( GET ) a list of glucose levels for a given user_id, filter by  start  and  stop  timestamps.
The endpoint should support pagination, sorting, and a way to limit the number of glucose levels returned.
2) "/api/v1/levels/<id>/"  Retrieve ( GET ) a particular glucose level by  id .

Implement a  POST  endpoint to fill / pre-populate the model / database via an API endpoint.
Implement an export feature, e.g. to  JSON ,  CSV , or  Excel  in the API.
Create means to run your solution locally, e.g. via minicube.

Make sure to use onion architecture as well as good oop practices, add error checks for passed parameters, use suitable URL routing, write unit-tests.
Documentation: added clear inline & high-level documentation, added docs on how to start & run the submitted solution
